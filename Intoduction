 Introduction to Programming
 The journey of programming is a fascinating evolution that spans decades of technological
 advancement. It all began in the mid-20th century, with the advent of the first computers.
 Early computing devices like the ENIAC and UNIVAC laid the foundation for digital
 computation, allowing complex mathematical calculations and data processing. However,
 these machines required intricate and time-consuming rewiring to perform different tasks,
 making them impractical for general-purpose use.
 The breakthrough came with the development of assembly languages in the 1950s.
 Assembly languages provided a symbolic representation of machine code instructions,
 making programming slightly more human-readable and accessible. Yet, they still demanded
 a deep understanding of the underlying hardware, limiting their use to highly skilled
 individuals.
 The 1950s also saw the birth of high-level programming languages. FORTRAN (Formula
 Translation) was among the first, designed for scientific and engineering applications. This
 marked a shift towards more user-friendly programming, enabling programmers to write
 code using familiar mathematical notations. COBOL (Common Business-Oriented
 Language) followed suit, catering to business data processing needs.
 The 1960s witnessed the rise of languages like BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
 Instruction Code) and ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language). These languages further abstracted
 programming, reducing the gap between code and machine instructions. However, it was the
 1970s that truly marked a turning point with the creation of C, a powerful language that
 combined low-level control with high-level abstraction. C became instrumental in developing
 operating systems and applications, laying the foundation for modern computing.
 The late 20th century and early 21st century brought forth a proliferation of high-level
 languages like Python, Java, and Ruby. These languages emphasised readability, ease of
 use, and portability, driving innovation across various domains. Additionally, object-oriented
 programming (OOP) gained traction, introducing a paradigm shift that facilitated modular and
 reusable code.
 Today, we stand at the threshold of an era where languages like Python, JavaScript, and
 C++ dominate the programming landscape. The evolution of programming languages
 continues with a focus on concurrency, parallelism, and scalability to meet the demands of
 modern computing, including artificial intelligence, data science, and cloud computing.
 In conclusion, the history of programming is a testament to human ingenuity, from the
 arduous days of machine code to the user-friendly high-level languages of today. Each
 phase of evolution has brought us closer to computers that can understand and execute
 human intentions, making technology accessible and transformative across the globe.

 Evolution of Java
 The evolution of Java is a remarkable journey that showcases the language's adaptability
 and enduring relevance in the ever-changing world of programming. Developed by James
 Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle Corporation), Java was
 released in 1995 and quickly gained traction due to its unique features and cross-platform
 capabilities.
 Java's early days saw it positioned as a language for building applets, which were small
 programs designed to run within web browsers. This allowed for interactive content on the
 emerging World Wide Web. However, Java's true breakthrough came with its "Write Once,
 Run Anywhere" mantra. By introducing the concept of platform independence through the
 Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java enabled programs to be compiled into bytecode that could
 be executed on any system with a compatible JVM. This marked a significant departure from
 languages tied to specific operating systems.
 The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed Java's expansion into various domains. The
 introduction of Java 2 (later renamed Java SE) brought important features like Swing for
 building graphical user interfaces and the Collections Framework for efficient data
 manipulation. Additionally, the enterprise space was revolutionised with the inception of Java
 EE (Enterprise Edition), which provided tools for creating large-scale, distributed
 applications.
 As the new millennium unfolded, Java's community-driven approach to development led to
 the creation of open-source implementations like OpenJDK. This not only made Java more
 accessible but also allowed for collaborative improvements to the language's core.
 The 2010s brought Java into the realm of modern programming challenges. Java's focus on
 performance, security, and portability made it a solid choice for building Android applications,
 powering millions of devices worldwide. Furthermore, the language underwent rapid updates
 with the introduction of features like lambdas, the Stream API, and modules in Java 8,
 enhancing its expressive power and making code more concise.
 Java's evolution continued with the release of Java 9, which brought modularity to the
 language through the Java Platform Module System (JPMS). Subsequent versions further
 refined and expanded upon this foundation, addressing issues related to scalability and
 performance in a multicore and cloud-driven landscape.
 In recent years, Java's relevance has extended to emerging technologies like cloud
 computing, microservices architecture, and serverless computing. The language remains a
 stalwart choice for enterprise applications, financial systems, and large-scale software
 development due to its reliability and ecosystem.

 In summary, Java's evolution from a language for applets to a versatile, enterprise-grade
 programming language is a testament to its adaptability, community support, and continuous
 improvement. With a strong foundation and ongoing innovation, Java continues to shape the
 present and future of programming.
